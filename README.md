# Chrome-tab-hider
Might be useful to anyone wondering how they can surf the web and at the same time hide the tabs they are visiting from anyone looking at their screens
What does it do:
-Hides tab names and tab icons
Could be annoying since the user itself might get confused by which tab is which.
Will update in future to add customization options for users.
